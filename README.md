# DigitalSimulation
Simulation of a Chinese Restaurant. Clients come to the restaurant, whether going to the buffet or sit in a table (chosen by a manager). People in a buffet are serving themselves and clients in tables are waiting to get served by the waiter. Next they all get to the cash register queue and end a simulation.
