# DigitalSimulation
Simulation of a Chinese Restaurant. Clients come to the restaurant, whether going to the buffet or sit in a table (chosen by a manager). People in a buffet are serving themselves and clients in tables are waiting to get served by the waiter. Next they all get to the cash register queue and end a simulation.
Whole program is based on a object-oriented programming.
We got stepping loop and constant loop. Ending condition of the simulation is the total clients pass by whole system. You can change it anytime.
Program also uses random generator described by a normal and exponential distribution to get maximum random numbers.
In a constant loop we got statistic in the end. Simulation take some time because of a lot of comments, but if we comment them - simulation for example for 50k clients take few secs.
Whole program and simulation were created for a subject DigitalSimulation.
