## DigitalSimulation

DigitalSimulation is a Simulation of a Chinese Restaurant. Written entirely in C#, using Object-oriented programming paradigm

# How it works?

Clients come to the restaurant, whether going to the buffet or sit in a table (chosen by a manager). People in a buffet are serving themselves and clients in tables are waiting to get served by the waiter. Next they all get to the cash register queue and then there is end of a simulation.

In main file there is stepping loop and constant loop. Ending condition of the simulation is the total clients pass by whole system. You can change it anytime.
Program also uses random generator described by a normal and exponential distribution to get maximum random numbers.
In a constant loop there is statistics shown in the end. 
Simulation may take some time because of a lot of comments in the code. Comment them for faster simulation - simulation for 50k clients should take few seconds.

# Project status
This simulation was made for a educational purpose only for a Digital Simulation subject and is not further developed.
